when
****

A wrapper library for date/time conversion.  Takes many of the standard ISO
date formats as strings and creates an internally consistent datetime object.

Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pywhen

Supports
========

pywhen has been tested with Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10

Previously it was tested with Python 2.7, not much has changed since then and
it should still work, but it isn't part of the automatic tests anymore.
